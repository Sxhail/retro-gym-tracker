# ðŸ“‹ Web Demo Development To-Do List

## Project Overview
Build a stand-alone web demo of the Retro Gym App without touching the mobile codebase. All demo logic, configuration, and assets must live in the `web-demo` directory.

## Critical Rules (Must Follow Exactly)
- âœ… **NEVER** modify any files in the `retro/` directory
- âœ… **NEVER** rename or delete mobile app files  
- âœ… All demo code must live in `web-demo/` directory only
- âœ… Copy assets and styles, don't reference originals
- âœ… Use mock data only, no SQLite in web demo
- âœ… Maintain cyberpunk terminal aesthetic throughout
- âœ… Ensure complete isolation between mobile and web demo
