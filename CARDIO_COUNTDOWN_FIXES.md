# Cardio Countdown Audio - Issue Fixes

## üêõ Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå **No foreground audio when user is using the app**
**Problem:** Completely disabled expo-av countdown audio service
**Solution:** Re-enabled hybrid approach:
- **Foreground:** expo-av plays `cardio-countdown.wav` when app is active
- **Background:** Notifications play `cardio-countdown.wav` when app is closed/backgrounded

### 2. ‚ùå **Default notification sound instead of custom audio**
**Problem:** Notification using default sound instead of `cardio-countdown.wav`
**Root Cause:** expo-notifications custom sound handling
**Solution:** Added debugging and improved sound parameter passing

## üîß Technical Fixes Applied

### Updated `hooks/useCardioSession.ts`:
- ‚úÖ **Re-enabled foreground countdown audio effect**
- ‚úÖ **Re-enabled audio stopping on pause/skip/cancel/reset**
- ‚úÖ **Hybrid approach:** expo-av for foreground + notifications for background

### Updated `services/iosNotifications.ts`:
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced notification handler** to always play sound for countdown notifications
- ‚úÖ **Added debugging logs** to track custom sound parameter
- ‚úÖ **Improved sound parameter handling**

### Updated `services/cardioBackgroundSession.ts`:
- ‚úÖ **Countdown notifications use custom sound** (`cardio-countdown.wav`)
- ‚úÖ **Added logging** for countdown notification scheduling

## üéµ How It Now Works

### When App is Active (Foreground):
```
3 seconds before work/run phase ends:
‚îú‚îÄ expo-av plays cardio-countdown.wav (immediate)
‚îî‚îÄ Notification scheduled but audio suppressed (prevents double audio)
```

### When App is Backgrounded/Closed:
```
3 seconds before work/run phase ends:
‚îú‚îÄ expo-av cannot play (app not active)
‚îî‚îÄ Notification plays cardio-countdown.wav (iOS system)
```

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Test Foreground Audio:
1. Start HIIT session with 10+ second work phases
2. Keep app open and active
3. **Should hear:** `cardio-countdown.wav` played by expo-av
4. **Should NOT see:** Notification popup (suppressed in foreground)

### Test Background Audio:
1. Start HIIT session
2. Background app (home button) or force-close
3. **Should hear:** `cardio-countdown.wav` played by notification
4. **Should see:** "3 SECONDS LEFT" notification

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Debugging Notes

### If Custom Sound Still Not Working in Notifications:
1. **Test on real iOS device** (required - simulator unreliable)
2. **Check device volume and notifications enabled**
3. **Verify console logs show:** `Scheduling notification with sound: cardio-countdown.wav`
4. **Alternative solution:** Use default notification sound + rely on foreground audio

### Console Debug Output:
```
[IOSNotifications] Scheduling notification with sound: cardio-countdown.wav
[IOSNotifications] Scheduled notification xxx for 3 SECONDS LEFT with sound: cardio-countdown.wav
[CardioBackgroundSession] Scheduling countdown notification for work phase at [timestamp]
```

## üéØ Expected Results

‚úÖ **Foreground:** Audio plays via expo-av when app is active
‚úÖ **Background:** Audio plays via notification when app is closed
‚úÖ **Force-closed:** Audio plays via notification (iOS scheduled delivery)
‚úÖ **Lock screen:** Audio plays via notification
‚úÖ **No double audio:** Only one source plays at a time

## üöÄ Ready for Testing

The implementation now provides:
1. **Immediate foreground audio** for active users
2. **Reliable background audio** for all closed/backgrounded scenarios
3. **No interruption** between foreground and background transitions
4. **Debugging capabilities** to verify custom sound delivery

Test both scenarios on a real iOS device to verify the complete solution!
