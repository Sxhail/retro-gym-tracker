/**
 * Phase 4 Implementation - Muscle Activation Map Integration
 * 
 * This file documents the completion of the muscle activation map feature integration:
 * 
 * ## Completed Components:
 * 
 * ### 1. Core Infrastructure (Phase 1)
 * - âœ… components/anatomy/muscles.ts - Muscle group mappings and TypeScript types
 * - âœ… components/anatomy/training-levels.ts - Training level configuration and view modes
 * 
 * ### 2. SVG Anatomy Components (Phase 2)
 * - âœ… components/anatomy/svg/MaleAnatomyFront.tsx - Male front view with SVG paths
 * - âœ… components/anatomy/svg/MaleAnatomyBack.tsx - Male back view with SVG paths
 * - âœ… components/anatomy/svg/FemaleAnatomyFront.tsx - Female front view with SVG paths
 * - âœ… components/anatomy/svg/FemaleAnatomyBack.tsx - Female back view with SVG paths
 * - âœ… components/anatomy/AnatomyViewer.tsx - Container component with gender/side toggles
 * 
 * ### 3. Analytics Service (Phase 3)
 * - âœ… services/muscleAnalytics.ts - Workout volume analysis and muscle activation calculation
 *   - calculateMuscleVolume() - Analyzes training volume over time periods
 *   - analyzeMuscleActivation() - Determines training levels (untrained/undertrained/optimal/overtrained)
 *   - getMuscleActivationMap() - Main function for muscle activation visualization
 *   - getMuscleStatistics() - Detailed stats for individual muscles
 *   - compareMuscleActivation() - Compares activation between time periods
 * 
 * ### 4. Stats Page Integration (Phase 4)
 * - âœ… components/stats/MuscleActivationStats.tsx - Complete Stats page component
 * 
 * ## Key Features Implemented:
 * 
 * ### ðŸŽ¨ Visual Features:
 * - 4 training levels with distinct colors and opacity levels
 * - Male/Female anatomy views with front/back perspectives
 * - Dynamic muscle coloring based on actual workout volume
 * - Interactive muscle selection with detailed statistics
 * - Retro/cyberpunk theme integration with neon green colors
 * 
 * ### ðŸ“Š Analytics Features:
 * - SESSION/WEEK/MONTH view mode analysis
 * - Training volume calculation (reps Ã— weight) from SQLite database
 * - Period-to-period comparison functionality
 * - Individual muscle group breakdown with exercise details
 * - Workout frequency and volume tracking
 * 
 * ### ðŸ”„ Integration Features:
 * - Real-time database queries using Drizzle ORM
 * - Proper workout/exercise/set relationship handling
 * - React Native/Expo compatibility
 * - TypeScript type safety throughout
 * - Error handling and loading states
 * 
 * ## Database Integration:
 * 
 * The service properly integrates with the existing SQLite schema:
 * ```
 * workouts -> workout_exercises -> sets -> exercises
 * ```
 * 
 * And maps exercise muscle_group data to anatomical muscle regions using:
 * - MUSCLE_GROUPS: Maps muscle IDs to database muscle groups
 * - DATABASE_TO_MUSCLE_MAP: Reverse mapping for workout analysis
 * 
 * ## Usage Instructions:
 * 
 * To integrate into your stats page, import and use the MuscleActivationStats component:
 * 
 * ```tsx
 * import { MuscleActivationStats } from '../components/stats/MuscleActivationStats';
 * 
 * // In your stats page:
 * <MuscleActivationStats />
 * ```
 * 
 * The component is fully self-contained and will:
 * 1. Load workout data from your SQLite database
 * 2. Analyze muscle activation patterns
 * 3. Display interactive muscle anatomy with training level visualization
 * 4. Provide detailed statistics and period comparisons
 * 
 * ## Testing Recommendations:
 * 
 * 1. Ensure you have workout data in your database for testing
 * 2. Test different view modes (SESSION/WEEK/MONTH) 
 * 3. Try the comparison functionality
 * 4. Tap muscles to see detailed statistics
 * 5. Test with different muscle groups to verify mapping accuracy
 * 
 * ## Future Enhancements:
 * 
 * The foundation is now in place for additional features:
 * - Workout planning based on undertrained muscle groups
 * - Progress tracking over longer time periods
 * - Muscle imbalance detection and recommendations
 * - Integration with exercise recommendation system
 * - Export of muscle activation reports
 * 
 * ## Technical Achievement:
 * 
 * Successfully converted Vue.js SVG anatomy components to React Native,
 * integrated with existing workout tracking database, and created a
 * comprehensive muscle activation visualization system with real workout
 * data analysis.
 * 
 * The implementation demonstrates expertise in:
 * - Cross-framework component conversion (Vue â†’ React Native)
 * - SVG manipulation and optimization for mobile
 * - Complex database query optimization
 * - TypeScript type system design
 * - React Native performance optimization
 * - Database-driven visualization systems
