# Rest Timer Background Persistence & Notification Fix - CORRECTED IMPLEMENTATION

## Critical Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Rest Timer Duration Calculation Bug
**Original Problem**: Timer was using `timeRemaining` as both the current countdown value AND the duration to save to background storage, causing incorrect persistence.

**Fix**: 
- Added `originalDuration` field to track the full timer duration
- Rest timer now correctly calculates remaining time as `originalDuration - elapsed`
- Background storage saves the original duration, not the current remaining time

### 2. Rest Timer Not Persisting Across Pages
**Original Problem**: Timer would reset when navigating between app pages due to improper background persistence.

**Fix**:
- Implemented proper timestamp-based calculations using `startTime` and `originalDuration`
- Rest timer state now saves/restores from SQLite background storage
- Timer continues accurately even when app is backgrounded or user navigates to different pages

### 3. Notification Callback Loop Issue  
**Original Problem**: Notification callback was being set up on every component render, potentially causing multiple triggers or showing on app startup.

**Fix**:
- Added `callbackSetRef` to ensure callback is only set once
- Callback cleanup properly handled on component unmount
- Enhanced path detection to prevent notification on workout page

## Implementation Details

### Context Changes (WorkoutSessionContext.tsx)
```typescript
// Added originalDuration to rest timer state
globalRestTimer: {
  isActive: boolean;
  timeRemaining: number;
  originalDuration: number; // NEW: tracks full duration
  exerciseId: number | null;
  setIdx: number | null;
  startTime: Date | null;
}

// Fixed timer calculation logic
const remaining = Math.max(0, globalRestTimer.originalDuration - elapsed);
```

### Background Persistence 
- Rest timer saves `originalDuration` to background storage
- On app restore, calculates correct remaining time from start time and original duration
- Automatic cleanup when timer completes or is cancelled

### Notification Component (GlobalRestTimerNotification.tsx)
```typescript
// Fixed callback setup with ref to prevent multiple triggers
const callbackSetRef = useRef(false);

useEffect(() => {
  if (!callbackSetRef.current) {
    callbackSetRef.current = true;
    setOnRestTimerComplete(() => {
      // Notification logic here
    });
  }
}, []); // Empty deps - runs only once
```

## Files Modified

1. **context/WorkoutSessionContext.tsx**
   - Added `originalDuration` to rest timer interface
   - Fixed timer calculation logic using timestamp-based approach
   - Enhanced background persistence with proper duration tracking
   - Added comprehensive logging for debugging

2. **app/new.tsx**
   - Updated rest timer initialization to include `originalDuration`
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing timer display

3. **components/GlobalRestTimerNotification.tsx**
   - Fixed callback setup to prevent multiple triggers
   - Enhanced path detection with fallback logic
   - Added comprehensive logging for debugging notification behavior

## Testing Verification

To verify fixes work correctly:

1. **Background Persistence Test**:
   - Start a rest timer
   - Navigate to different app pages (history, stats, etc.)
   - Timer should continue counting down accurately
   - Return to workout page - timer displays correct remaining time

2. **App Backgrounding Test**:
   - Start a rest timer
   - Close/background the app completely
   - Reopen app after some time
   - Timer should restore with correct remaining time

3. **Notification Test**:
   - Start a rest timer
   - Navigate away from workout page before timer completes
   - Should see "REST COMPLETED" notification when timer finishes
   - Timer completion while ON workout page should NOT show notification

4. **No False Notifications Test**:
   - Open app fresh (no active rest timer)
   - Should NOT see any notifications
   - Multiple app restarts should never trigger false notifications

## Technical Architecture

- **Timer State**: Uses timestamp-based calculations for accuracy
- **Background Storage**: SQLite persistence identical to main workout timer
- **Notification Logic**: Path-aware callback system with proper cleanup
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try/catch with logging
