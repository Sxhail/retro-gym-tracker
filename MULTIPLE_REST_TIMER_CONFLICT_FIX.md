# Multiple Rest Timer Conflict Issue - FIXED

## Problem Description
Users experienced a major issue where **multiple rest timers would run simultaneously** during lift sessions. This occurred when:

1. User completes a set in Exercise A (rest timer starts)
2. User adds a new Exercise B 
3. User completes a set in Exercise B
4. **BOTH** rest timers from Exercise A and Exercise B would be active simultaneously

This created a confusing and disruptive user experience where old rest timers from previous exercises would interfere with new exercise rest timers.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by **insufficient cleanup** of old rest timer data:

1. **Background Persistence**: The `useBackgroundRestTimerPersistence` hook was restoring old rest timers from the database
2. **Multiple Records**: Old rest timer database records were not being properly cleaned up when new timers started
3. **Race Conditions**: New rest timers were started without clearing existing ones, leading to conflicts
4. **Restoration Logic**: The restoration process could restore multiple timers simultaneously

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Aggressive Cleanup in Set Completion (`app/new.tsx`)
- Modified `handleToggleSetComplete` to **clean up ALL existing rest timer records** before starting a new one
- Added database cleanup to remove orphaned rest timer data
- Added proper async/await handling with error recovery

### 2. Enhanced Background Persistence Logic (`useBackgroundRestTimerPersistence.ts`)
- **Reduced cleanup threshold** from 2 hours to 10 minutes for more aggressive cleanup
- **Enhanced multiple timer detection**: When multiple timers are found, clean ALL of them up (including the most recent)
- **Improved session ID generation**: Clean up existing records before creating new session IDs
- **Better restoration logic**: Only restore if exactly one valid timer exists

### 3. Exercise Addition Protection (`app/new.tsx`)
- Enhanced `handleAddExerciseFromPicker` with additional rest timer cleanup when adding new exercises
- Prevents old rest timers from carrying over to new exercises

### 4. Database Maintenance
- Automatic cleanup when workout sessions end
- Orphaned timer cleanup on app startup
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Technical Changes

### Key Files Modified:
1. **`app/new.tsx`**: Enhanced set completion and exercise addition logic
2. **`hooks/useBackgroundRestTimerPersistence.ts`**: Improved restoration and cleanup logic

### Core Logic Changes:
```typescript
// Before starting new rest timer:
1. Clear existing global rest timer
2. Clean up ALL database records for rest timers
3. Wait for cleanup completion
4. Start new rest timer with fresh session ID
```

### Safety Mechanisms Added:
- **Multiple timer detection**: Prevents simultaneous timer conflicts
- **Aggressive age-based cleanup**: Removes timers older than 10 minutes
- **Database consistency**: Ensures clean database state before new operations
- **Error recovery**: Comprehensive error handling prevents app crashes

## Result
✅ **FIXED**: No more multiple simultaneous rest timers  
✅ **FIXED**: Clean transitions between exercises  
✅ **FIXED**: Proper rest timer isolation per exercise/set  
✅ **IMPROVED**: Database maintenance and cleanup  
✅ **IMPROVED**: Error handling and logging  

## User Experience Impact
- **Clean Experience**: Only one rest timer active at a time
- **Predictable Behavior**: Rest timers behave consistently
- **No Interference**: Previous exercise timers don't affect new exercises
- **Reliable Persistence**: Background persistence works without conflicts

## Deployment
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED to production
- **Update ID**: 260b9146-205b-4460-acce-d7f26633f400 (Android), 924fe5a0-1de3-4477-9785-318774103ecc (iOS)
- **Date**: 2025-08-20
- **Branch**: production

This fix resolves the critical multiple rest timer conflict issue and ensures a clean, predictable rest timer experience for users during lift sessions.
