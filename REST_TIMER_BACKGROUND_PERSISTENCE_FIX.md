# Rest Timer Background Persistence & Notification Fix

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Rest Timer Not Working Across Pages
**Issue**: Rest timer would get stuck or reset when user navigated to different pages of the app.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented background persistence for rest timers using SQLite storage
- Added rest timer restoration on app start
- Used timestamp-based calculations to maintain accuracy across page navigation
- Rest timer now works identically to the main workout timer persistence system

### 2. Popup Shown on Every App Opening
**Issue**: The "REST COMPLETED" popup was shown every time user opened the app, not just when timer actually completed while user was on a different page.

**Solution**:
- Modified notification logic to only trigger when timer naturally completes
- Added page detection to only show notification when user is NOT on workout page (/new)
- Prevented notification callback from firing during app startup/restoration

## Implementation Details

### Background Persistence
- Extended `BackgroundSessionService` with `clearTimerData()` method
- Rest timers saved to `active_session_timers` table with type 'rest'
- Automatic cleanup when timer completes or is cancelled

### Context Changes
- Added `restTimerSessionId` state for tracking background storage
- Implemented rest timer restoration on app initialization
- Enhanced global rest timer effect with proper background lifecycle management

### Notification Logic
- Used `usePathname()` to detect current page
- Only show notification when user is NOT on `/new` (workout page)
- Added console logging for debugging timer completion events

## Files Modified

1. **context/WorkoutSessionContext.tsx**
   - Added rest timer restoration on app start
   - Enhanced global rest timer effect with background persistence
   - Added restTimerSessionId state management

2. **services/backgroundSession.ts**
   - Added `clearTimerData()` method for specific timer cleanup
   - Supports both 'workout' and 'rest' timer types

3. **components/GlobalRestTimerNotification.tsx**
   - Added page detection using `usePathname()`
   - Conditional notification display based on current route
   - Enhanced debugging with console logs

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Start rest timer and navigate to different pages
- [ ] Rest timer continues counting in background
- [ ] Return to workout page shows correct remaining time
- [ ] Timer completion while on different page shows notification
- [ ] Timer completion while on workout page does NOT show notification
- [ ] App restart during active rest timer restores timer correctly
- [ ] App restart after timer completion does not show notification
- [ ] Timer cleanup works properly when cancelled

## Technical Notes

- Rest timer now uses same persistence architecture as main workout timer
- Timestamp-based calculations ensure accuracy across app states
- Background storage automatically cleaned up on completion/cancellation
- Notification respects user's current location in app
